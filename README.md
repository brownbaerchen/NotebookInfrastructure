# NotebookInfrastructure
This is a playground for setting up Jupyter notebooks for tutorials. The main focus is to embed them into a GitHub continuous integration pipeline. In the pipeline, tests should be executed that continually verify functionality and correctness of the notebooks and the test coverage of the notebooks should be merged with a report for the other tests.
